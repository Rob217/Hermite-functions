# Hermite function calculator

### Hermite functions
This package calculates the [Hermite functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials#Hermite_functions),

\psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} \frac{1}{\pi^{1/4}} \text{e}^{-x^2/2} H_n(x)
-->

where n is a non-negative integer, x is a position, and H_n(x) are the [Hermite polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials).

### Quantum harmonic oscillator
The Hermite functions are related to the wavefunctions of the [quantum harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator) via the relation


which can be used for calculating the wavefunctions of the .
